  <p>My studies are advancing quite well ahead of schedule so I wrote my Batchelor’s thesis already this spring although it was just my second year. I still don’t have all the required courses to graduate this summer but am hoping to do so sometime later this year, before Christmas.</p>
  <p>The thesis is a literature review about building a chess AI using machine learning. It’s written in Finnish as required by my university, but I’m planning to write at least one article on this site about it in English aswell at some point. The main areas the thesis covers creating an evaluation function for a chess state using reinforcement learning and explaining how temporal difference learning can be used together with neural networks to make this work. The function approximator created this way can then be used with any existing chess engine to use when evaluationg states.</p>
  <p>I also covered probability limited search shortly, which was created by <a href="//matthewlai.ca/resume/">Matthew Lai</a> for his <a href="//arxiv.org/abs/1509.01549">Giraffe chess engine</a> to replace depth limitation with minimax search. This approach tries to figure, using machine learning, which branches of the game tree and how deep to look to try and find the best move, just like depth limitation, but is generalized and so does not require accurate rules handwritten by people to work, but discovers the rules itself.</p>
  <p>The thesis was evaluated with 5 of 5 and I got feedback from the professor evaluating it that the paper was very clear, consistent and comprehensive. I had some errors with compound words and comma placements and a few minor flaws with the bibliography layout from copying BibTex files without cleaning them up properly. All and all, quite successful Batchelor’s thesis however. <a href="//darth.kipsu.fi/papers/kandi.pdf">You can read it here</a>.</p>
