  <p>You peel off pedals from a flower to find out if your true love loves you – or not. The game uses a set formula to calculate from your name and your loved ones name, to decide the outcome of the game.</p>

  <h3>Comments</h3>

  <p>This was a “stupid idea” my spouse an I had in late Valentine’s Day evening. Took about 3 hours from the idea to a completed game. My contribution was mainly the graphics and how to get the flower assembled.</p>

  <h3>What I could have done better</h3>
  <p>I was so slow at making my part, that my spouse did almost everything himself!</p>

  <h3>Lesson learned</h3>

  <p>Don’t try to embark on a project with too strict schedule. We finished the game just before midnight and had we got more time, the outcome could have been a lot more professional.</p>
