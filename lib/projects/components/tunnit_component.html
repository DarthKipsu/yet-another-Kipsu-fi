  <p>Tunnit was also made as a laboratory course work for University, but because I wanted to learn Rails more, it ended up being a tad more comprehensive than needed for the 2 credits.</p>
  <p>It’s for keeping track of your working hours on your personal projects. You can also create and join teams to share projects with your co-workers. Once you have a project set up, you can allocate hours for each member of the project to keep track on how well on schedule your team is staying and easily see how much time is used for each project. Adding hours is easy, there’s a parser that will allow you to add the hours in several easy formats and you can pick the date from a handy date picker.</p>
  <p>The app includes user login and sessions and displays a user only their own hours and projects where the user has team member status. Pdf reports for single users or all users for a project can be created easily.</p>
  <p>The app has wide test coverage and the quality of the code is being monitored with Code Climate. Travis CI is used as a continuous integration service.</p>
  <p>Logging in is required to use the app. For previewing you can use credentials tapsa@testaaja.fi and password Salainen1 (please don't delete it or change the password... :)</p>

  <h3>Comments</h3>

  <p>I tried to pay attention to quality development process with the project. I had tests from the beginning and implemented continuous integration as soon as I had something to publish. I tried to refactor often to keep the code at healthy state. I had my spouse test the app to get feedback and kept a light product backlog to keep track of my process. Everything seemed to work smoothly and it was a joy to work with the project.</p>

  <h3>What I could have done better</h3>

  <p>The UI design of the site is not very eye-catching and there’s some usability issues, like the team invitations only show up when you’re in the users own page.</p>

  <h3>Lesson learned</h3>

  <p>Things pan out quite nicely when you have good tests for refactoring and continuous integration to spot creeping problems early.</p>
