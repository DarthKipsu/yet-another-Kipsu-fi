  <p>I think the most comforting message from the visual design session of <a href="//reaktor.com/academy">Reaktor Academy</a> was that you don’t need to be a natural talent for becoming fluent with visual design. Everything can be learned, if you do a lot of practicing and studying. On top of that great advice, we also got some concrete recommendations on what to focus our minds on when doing visual design.</p>

  <p>The ten principles for good design by Dieter Rams are a good starting place for studying visual design. They give you a sense of where to aim for. Especially the last point is something worth to remember. It’s the same as with coding; aim for as little as possible.</p>
  <p>The visual design session was full of practical tips. For example to always start designing without colors and then add meaningful colors later when the design looks elegant even without. Also never to use black in your design. (Bad me for using black in the drawings, it comes too easily from the program I use!) Black is not very natural color and you can observe nature having more shades of gray. Instead of black, one could for example use something like #333333.</p>
  <p>You should also consider affordance; the relation between objects and their environment. It should be obvious for the user, where everything on your design is and what are the things interactive to the them. Buttons for example should be recognizable, something many flat UI’s fail to provide. Color and shadows should be used as guidance for the user and they should be used consistently throughout the site.</p>
  <p>When starting out with visual design (and maybe later too) it’s a good thing to look at other sites and applications and take a note on the good things they have. Like Picasso once said; “good artists copy - great artists steal”. You should take all the ideas you like about what you see and base your own work on top of those.</p>
