  <p>There’s no applications without users. The ease of use is one of the major factors of enjoyable applications. Without it, the only reason users may not be leaving is, if they need the app and there’s no better competition. Still, it seems designing for usability is something lost for a lot of software (or hardware for the matter) companies.</p>
  <p>One of my favorite examples of poor usability is our dear microwave. There’s over 20 programs to fulfill the most precise needs of people wanting to heat food. You can heat with different temperatures, use a grill resistors or even convection. The only thing we use is simple heating with full temperature, because anything else is difficult to find and unintuitive if you don’t happen to have an user manual next to you. Things you’d like to use regularly like the timer are behind other less important options. And even the simple heating requires us to press several buttons. If the thing wouldn’t look good, (and it would be less of a trouble to buy a new one) we’d trash it yesterday.</p>
  <p>Some programs require you to learn a lot of stuff before you can get into them. One example is the image editor <a href="//www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> for Linux. It follows in the footsteps of Photoshop and has a lot of features, but in my opinion is terrible for use. A lot of the features are difficult to find, in some cases doing simple operations is impossible without either going through the upper menu or learning a keyboard shortcut (which is not displayed to you in the menu for easy access). You even have to click a proper box to zoom. A proper image editor is actually the only thing I miss about Windows.</p>

  <h3>So how could we do better?</h3>

  <p>One solution I learned about during the UI session of Reaktor Academy was to use simulation based user interface planning. In this method the designer would take one user story at a time and simulate fulfilling that story with the product being made. Each user story would change the simulated UI (if needed) until fulfilling all of them was possible and smooth. The main thing was for the designer to click all the clicks needed, select the selections etc. to really get the feel of what the user of the application is really required to do.</p>
  <p>Another point in simulating was that the designer would think while doing the simulation, about what would the user want to know and how would they feel while performing the tasks. This would for example reveal what kind of additional info the application should present the user.</p>

  <p>The example case is about ordering a taxi with a mobile app. The above picture represents a user case for getting from Reaktor offices back to University as quickly as possible. The first thing to do is order the taxi to where the user is, identified by their phone location services. To speed up getting the taxi, the location where the user is headed is only typed after ordering.</p>
  <p>While typing the location where the user is going, maybe the designer notices it’s quite dull typing the location every time, when most likely you will often travel to the same locations. Any idea of further improvements is written down and if substantive enough, a new user story is created based on them. The idea is to have as little design as possible, to avoid letting the application getting too crowded and difficult to use.</p>
  <p>While drawing the interfaces, the designer also needs to remember to keep constantly simulating. Pressing the buttons, typing everything the user needs to type and so on. If something gets too repetitive and you feel like you’re doing the same things again and again unnecessary, then maybe you are? Count your clicks. Maybe there is a better way?</p>
  <p>Love your users. Don’t make them have to trouble themselves with the app you’re designing. Make their lives easier.</p>
