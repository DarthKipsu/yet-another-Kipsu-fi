  <p>I first read about Huffman’s algorithm from the great Lisp book <a href="//mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. The algorithm has a really interesting idea about storing data with prefixes based on the occurrences (weight) of the symbols being stored. The more times a symbol occurs in the data, the shorter the prefix is, causing the data compression volume to be larger.</p>
  <p>The algorithm bases on having data about the occurrences of symbols. You can count the symbols or use “typical data”, for example when the data is English text, it’s most common character might typically be space, followed by <span class="val">e</span> or <span class="val">t</span>. After finding the occurrences, a binary tree is formed with each symbol as a leaf, ordered so that the most common characters are closer to the top of the tree. The prefix for each character is obtained by going down the tree and adding <span class="val">0</span> each time you need to turn left and <span class="val">1</span> to right (or the other way around, as long as it’s consistent). This causes the most common characters having shorter prefixes and bigger compression rate.</p>
  <div class="photo"><img src="/packages/kipsu_fi/assets/articles/huffman2.jpg" /></div>
  <p>The image displays a tree created from text <strong>“pakattavaa tekstii”</strong>. <span class="val">A</span> is the most common characters, occurring 5 times, following by <span class="val">T</span> 4 times. <span class="val">I</span> and <span class="val">K</span> appear twice while others occur just once. So we get a occurences list of <span class="val">{A:5, T:4, I:2, K:2, S:1, V:1, E:1, P:1, :1}</span>. These are set as the weights of the leafs (blue in the image). Parent nodes also have a weight based on their children.</p>
  <p>We start creating the tree from the bottom of the occurrences list. The first node will have <span class="val">P</span> and space as it’s leafs, the second <span class="val">E</span> and the just created node. The parent node of <span class="val">E</span> has a weight of 3, which is greater than the combined weight of <span class="val">S</span> and <span class="val">V</span>, so we create a new parent node from them with weight of 2. We always try to combine the smallest possible weight we can get for the parent node, so I is combined with <span class="val">S</span> and <span class="val">V</span> to create weight 4 and <span class="val">K</span> with <span class="val">E</span>, <span class="val">P</span> and <span class="val">space</span> and so on. Finally when we have no new symbols, we combine our parent nodes to create a tree with a total weight of 18.</p>
  <div class="photo"><img src="/packages/kipsu_fi/assets/articles/huffman3.jpg" /></div>
  <p>Now that we have formed the tree, we can assign prefixes based on the symbols locations down the tree. Each edge we travel down right adds 1 to the prefix and 0 for left. <span class="val">A</span> is one edge right, then one left, so it’s assigned a prefix 10, while I is one left, then right and left again so the prefix is 010.</p>
  <p>Using this type of prefix assignment, we can be sure that no prefix starts with a prefix of another symbol. This is why we don’t need any separator between prefixes, even though they are not all of the same length. If you have a code 10110010 you can decode it easily by starting from the root and going down until you land in one of the leafs. 10 will take you to <span class="val">A</span>, 110 to <span class="val">E</span> and 010 ti <span class="val">I</span>, so the text behind that encoding is unambiguously <strong>“aki”</strong>.</p>
  <p>The text “pakattavaa tekstii” with the Huffman tree drawn above is about 36% of the size it would be with UTF-8 encoding. The more occurrences of the same letters there is the better the algorithm works. I practiced implementing it with Java and Clojure below.</p>
