  <p>My two months at <a href="//futurice.com/">Futurice</a> are nearing to their ends but I did have time to attend to the onboarding camp and Futucamp training events before moving to the next challenges. Onboarding is meant for new Futurice employees as a training about the company values and other related stuff. Futucamp is a yearly session of sharing knowledge between all employees, following big summer parties.</p>

  <p>The main offerings of the first day of onboarding was the mindset a software developer should obtain. You should think like the customer, help them in any way you can, and in return they will help you. Deliver what they need, not necessarily what they want. This is all part of trying to make a better product, creating something that will serve for the need the product was intended for.</p>
  <p>Your customer wants your services, because you have the knowledge to make the best product. Make it easy for the customer, make them want to work with you. Support positive atmosphere and co-operation between the team members and the client. The easier it is for you to communicate because of good atmosphere, the more you will do it. And more is better when communicating. Raise problems early, before they are big ones and never hide them. Raise problems you see outside your own domain. Don’t think if it’s not your fault or your area, that it would not be your problem.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most important part of lean service creation is the build - measure - learn feedback loop. It’s most likely impossible to get the product right without it, no matter how careful planning would have been used while creating the requirements for the project. It’s the basis of any agile software development. Speed is in essence here, create something based on a user story, measure the reaction of the customer or end users and act based on those measurements. Be ready to throw everything out if it was not what was wanted. This is why the loop is small, to be able to react quickly. After learning from your previous build, refine the product in the next loop, but remember; small steps.</p>

  <p>This goes back to validating the product. Try to create the most value for your customer. Think about the motives for the problem, are you trying to create the correct solution for the problem or just some solution? Love the problem, not the solution; don’t get stuck with your own ideas. Use facts instead of feelings.</p>
  <p>You need to understand the big picture, to be able to do the most valuable thing. And you should always try to create the most value to your customer. Just remember; no code is best code!</p>
  <p>My time at Futu has been a great learning experience and a motivator (like I’d need more). Time has been flying for the past weeks and I’m saddened that it’s almost time to move to my next challenges. After all these aphorisms I’ve filled this post with, one thing’s for sure. Having a great team with great people is surely the most important part of the development.</p>
