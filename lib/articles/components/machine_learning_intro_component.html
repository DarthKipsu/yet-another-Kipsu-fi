  <p>Machine learning has recently became the holy grail of computer science. It branched off from working with AI’s when people noticed it can be used for so much more. Machine learning is being used everywhere on big tech companies like Google. The STEP Intern Summit I visited last August at Google’s London office was full of presentations and hints about how machine learning is the next big thing. I had an interest on the subject before, but this only strengthened my idea of machine learning as being one part of computer sciences where I want to have a deeper look.</p>
  <p>Machine learning is useful for solving a lot of computational problems. Usually it’s considered for tasks that are too complex to be solved by programming an unambiguous solution for, like natural language processing or computer vision. It also suits well for programs that need to customize on changing environment, for example predicting stock prices or recommending you movies to watch. On top of this, studying machine learning will also give us valuable information about how human brain works.</p>
  <p>The basic idea is, you have some data and you want to create a model based on, to understand the data better or to get some actions from it. Machine learning is the middle piece to create the model from the data.</p>

  <p>There are two types of machine learning. First is supervised learning, which means your data is labeled and the algorithm needs to learn how to label unseen data in a similar way. For example you might have images of handwritten digits as your data, the labels would be which number each data item represents.</p>
  <p>Within supervised machine learning you could do binary or multiclass classification, where like in the example below, you would label data inputs into two or more categories. You could also have a multi label classification, where a single data item could belong to more than one category. With regression, you would have a real-value output, like for example a percentage for how likely some condition is positive.</p>
  <p>Supervised machine learning is usually easier to do and measure, but labeling data is expensive and time-consuming. The second type of machine learning is unsupervised learning, which tries to solve the labeling problem. With unsupervised learning, your main goal is usually to find correlations and structure in the data. The algorithm is given no right answers and it must learn what is important itself.</p>
  <p>With unsupervised learning, perhaps the most common goal is to cluster the data into groups of data points which are similar to each other. Another common goal is to find different association rules, for example which books in an online bookstore are often associated together, to make recommendations. You could also use unsupervised learning to reduce dimensions for data later used for supervised learning (with minimum data loss), which is called semi-supervised learning.</p>
