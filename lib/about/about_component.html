  <p>I'm Verna Koskinen, a second year computer sciences student from Helsinki, Finland.</p>

  <p>I have a previous degree in environmental sciences, but begun studying programming just before Christmas in 2013 and completely fell for it! Iâ€™m still exploring the field and having fun learning new things. Seems like in programming, learning new can never stop - how fun is that! I like problem solving and math, so this is definitely my thing.</p>

  <p>In my free time, when not learning about programming, I like to get outside with my dog and spouse and go walking in the forest, hiking or cycling. Nature is really important to me and I think caring for the environment and spending time in the nature is one of the best ways to keep ones mind at ease.</p>
